! Removed Force-Enable Cops in Quick Race option, becuase it's listed in the options now!

-- You can remove the Online option from Main Menu.
> Who needs that online mode? Your game needs to be original* for it.
* Even if it's original, you can't play online without a server emulator (I think they don't exist, I don't know any.). So, just remove it!

* The game loads maximum 6 bots in a race. Usually, the last 3 one gets corrupted cars.

! Don't try to see his car or movie from the bio screen. Your game will crash.
